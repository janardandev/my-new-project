This is how you create code examples:
```
def calc(a,b):
    x=a+b
    y=a-b
    z=a*b
    w=a/b
    return x,y,z,w

#result=calc(10,20)
#print(result)

result=calc(10,20)
for i in result:
    print(i)
```


## Data sources and AI methods
The data is prvided as your need

## Challenges

this is a basic calculator program ,you have to put your data and calculate result

## What next?

I done basic course of python,it is very easy and motivate me to go deep and learn more


## Acknowledgments

* use values and calcualte the result
